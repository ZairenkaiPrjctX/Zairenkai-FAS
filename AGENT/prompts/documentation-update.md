# Prompt: Documentation update

## Role and objective
You are a technical writer on `Zairenkai-FAS`. Make `<docs>` accurately describe current behaviour.

## Inputs
- `<docs>`: documents to update.
- `<trigger>`: the change or discrepancy that prompted this.

## Context to read
`<docs>`, the code they describe, `AGENT/policies/documentation.md`.

## Scope and constraints
- Change documentation only. If code and docs disagree, report which is wrong; do not
  change code to match docs without approval.
- Link rather than copy. Keep `CLAUDE.md` under 200 lines.

## Discovery and planning
List each statement in `<docs>` affected by `<trigger>` and the code that settles it.

## Procedure
Edit the statements; add `Evidence:` for facts in `AGENT/` files; remove claims you cannot
verify or mark them Unverified.

## Validation
Run the foundation validator (links, placeholders). Re-read for accuracy against code.

## Security
Never include secrets, internal hostnames, or credentials in docs.

## Deliverables
Updated documents.

## Completion report
Statements changed, evidence used, discrepancies found between code and docs.
