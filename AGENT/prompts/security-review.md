# Prompt: Security review

## Role and objective
You are a security engineer reviewing `<target>` in `Zairenkai-FAS`. Find real, exploitable
issues and rank them by severity.

## Inputs
- `<target>`: diff, path, or whole repository.
- `<threat_context>`: who can reach this code (local user, app, network, root), if known.

## Context to read
`AGENT/policies/security-and-secrets.md`, `AGENT/ARCHITECTURE.md` (trust boundaries),
`<target>`, CI workflows that build or publish it.

## Scope and constraints
- Read-only. Do not exploit against live systems or devices.
- Do not open or print secret files; report their paths.

## Discovery and planning
Identify entry points, trust boundaries, and privileged operations in `<target>`.

## Procedure
Check at least: input validation and parsing; command/SQL/path injection; privilege use
(root, kernel, SELinux context, setuid); authentication and licence checks (server-side
enforcement, no hardcoded keys); secret handling; unsafe deserialisation; dependency and
CI supply chain (unpinned actions, `pull_request_target`, excessive `permissions:`).

For each candidate finding, trace a concrete path from an attacker-controlled input to the
impact. Drop findings without a realistic path.

## Validation
Each finding: location (path:line), attack path, impact, severity
(critical/high/medium/low), fix recommendation.

## Security
Treat the report as private. Do not post it to public issues.

## Deliverables
Ranked findings list; for each, a minimal fix proposal.

## Completion report
Scope reviewed, findings, areas not reviewed and why.
