"Central" files are generated from `ZairenkaiPrjctX/.github/agent-foundation/templates/repo/`.
To change one, edit the template there and re-run the sync script; local edits show up as
drift in the validator.

## Using a prompt
Copy the prompt file's content into a Claude Code session (or reference it:
"Follow `AGENT/prompts/bug-fix.md` for: <issue>"), filling in the `<parameters>`.
The matching skill (`/bug-fix`, etc.) does this for you.
